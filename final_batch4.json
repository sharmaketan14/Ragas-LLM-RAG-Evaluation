This section prohibits any act which offends modesty or creates an undesirable environment, including unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature.\n\n2. **Right to report**: Indian citizens have the right to report and seek legal action against such harassment without fear of victimization. The law provides safe avenues for redressal through various mechanisms like police reports, complaints at designated women-friendly cells/stations, online complaint portals and so on.\n\n3. **Protection from discrimination**: Sexual harassment in the workplace is considered a form of discrimination under Section 125B of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. This act prohibits any act that causes outrage to feelings of hatred or contempt on grounds of race, caste, religion, sex, place of birth or residence.\n\n4. **Appeals**: An aggrieved person has the right to appeal against an order passed by a Magistrate/Additional District and Sessions Judge (Magistrate) within 15 days under Section 637 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The High Court may also entertain appeals.\n\n5. **Protection from workplace**: In cases where sexual harassment is proved in the course of work or employment, the employer shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years under Section 354B of IPC.
