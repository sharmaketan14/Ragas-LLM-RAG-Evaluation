As per the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, employers have a legal responsibility to create a safe working environment for all employees.\n\nThe Act defines 'sexual harassment' as any unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that is likely to cause or has caused embarrassment, humiliation, discomfort or intimidation to the victim. Employers are expected to take prompt and appropriate action in response to complaints of sexual harassment, which includes conducting an inquiry into the allegations, taking disciplinary action against the perpetrator, and providing support to the victim.\n\nIf an employer fails to take adequate measures to prevent sexual harassment despite having received complaints from other employees, they can be held liable for not fulfilling their statutory obligations. This can lead to legal consequences, including fines and even criminal penalties in extreme cases.\n\nIt is essential for employers to have a clear policy and procedure in place for dealing with complaints of sexual harassment, and to ensure that all employees are aware of the policy and their rights under it. Employers must also provide training on sexual harassment prevention and response to ensure that all employees understand what constitutes sexual harassment and how to report incidents without fear of retaliation.\n\nIn conclusion, employers have a legal responsibility to prevent sexual harassment in the workplace, and failure to take adequate measures can result in liability.

            "ground_truth": "As an experienced and skilled Indian corporate lawyer, I must emphasize that sexual harassment is unacceptable in any workplace. As a daily wage worker on a construction site, you have several options to report the incident and seek protection. Firstly, you can lodge a complaint with the local police or the Women's Helpline (1098) under the Protection of Women from Sexual Harassment at Workplace Act, 2013.\n\nSecondly, you can approach your supervisor's superior or HR department to report the harassment. If your supervisor is not responsive, you can escalate the matter to the principal employer's HR department. Under the Indian laws, sexual harassment is a violation of human dignity and is considered an offense.\n\nYou should also be aware that as a daily wage worker, you are still protected by labor laws. The Labour Laws (Exemptions and Amendments) Act, 1981 defines 'employee' broadly to include anyone who is employed at a workplace for any work on regular, temporary, ad hoc or daily wage basis. This includes contractors and their workers.\n\nIt's essential to keep in mind that your supervisor's claim that you're just an 'agent' and not a direct employee of the principal employer does not excuse his behavior. You have the right to report the harassment and seek justice.\n\nIn conclusion, as a daily wage worker on a construction site, you have several options to report sexual harassment and seek protection under Indian laws.

            "ground_truth": "While the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 is focused on protecting women from sexual harassment in the workplace, you can still file a complaint as an Indian citizen if your sister is being sexually harassed. However, there are some limitations.\n\nAccording to the law, only 'complainants' who are women and are victims of sexual harassment can file complaints under this Act. Since your sister is the victim, she would need to file the complaint herself.\n\nHowever, you as an Indian citizen can still play a crucial role in supporting your sister during this process. You can encourage her to report the incident to the Internal Complaint Committee (ICC) or the Local Complaint Committee (LCC), which are responsible for investigating and resolving sexual harassment complaints under the Act.\n\nAdditionally, if your sister is not comfortable reporting the incident herself, she may ask you or another trusted family member or friend to accompany her to file the complaint. Your support can be crucial in ensuring that the complaint is filed successfully and that your sister receives the necessary protection and assistance.\n\nIn summary, while only women who are victims of sexual harassment can file complaints under this Act, you as an Indian citizen can still play a vital role in supporting your sister during this process.",

            "ground_truth": "As an Indian citizen facing sexual harassment at your workplace, you can take the following steps to file a complaint and get justice:\n\nFirstly, familiarize yourself with the company's internal complaints mechanism and procedures for handling sexual harassment cases. Most companies have a Sexual Harassment Committee (SHC) or a Grievance Redressal Committee that handles such complaints.\n\nNext, document all incidents of sexual harassment, including dates, times, locations, and descriptions of what happened. Also, keep a record of any conversations or meetings with the harasser or anyone else involved.\n\nIf you feel comfortable doing so, file a written complaint to the SHC or the Grievance Redressal Committee. Provide as much detail as possible about the incidents and any attempts made by the harasser to cover up their actions.\n\nThe committee will then conduct an inquiry into your complaint, giving you and the accused an opportunity to present your sides of the story. If the committee finds that sexual harassment has occurred, it may impose disciplinary action on the perpetrator, including warnings, fines, or even termination of employment.\n\nIf the internal process does not provide satisfactory relief, you can also file a police complaint under Section 354A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), which criminalizes sexual harassment. The police will investigate your complaint and take appropriate action against the accused.\n\nRemember that filing a complaint is just the first step towards getting justice.

            "ground_truth": "When a company employee is found guilty of sexual harassment and faces a fine equal to twice the maximum fine for the same offence, the court would consider several factors before awarding this punishment. These factors include:\n\n* The gravity of the offence: The court would assess the severity of the sexual harassment committed by the accused.\n* Previous convictions or similar incidents: If the accused has been previously convicted of sexual harassment or has a history of similar incidents, the court may take these into account while determining the appropriate punishment.\n* The impact on the victim: The court would consider the emotional and psychological distress caused to the victim as a result of the sexual harassment.\n* The accused's conduct during the investigation: The court might assess the accused's cooperation or lack thereof during the investigation, including their willingness to provide evidence or apologize for their actions.\n\nIn addition, the court would also take into account the provisions of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, which provides for a maximum fine of three months' salary as punishment for sexual harassment. Twice this amount, i.e., six months' salary, is considered a severe penalty and would require careful consideration by the court.\n\nIn any case, the court's primary concern would be ensuring that the punishment is proportionate to the gravity of the offence and serves as a deterrent to others.",

This section deals with the cognizance of offences by courts.\n\nIf you are found guilty, the court may award a punishment that is proportionate to the severity of the offence.

Firstly, you can talk to the harasser and explain how their behavior is making you feel.

The first step is to approach the Internal Committee (IC) constituted by your employer. The IC must consist of a presiding officer who is a woman, an external committee member, and a legal expert.\n\nThe IC will investigate your complaint and take necessary action against the harasser. You can also file a police complaint if you feel that the situation is serious or if you need additional protection.\n\nIn addition to reporting the incident to your HR department or the IC, you can also seek support from friends, family, or a counselor.

The courts may provide guidance on the matter, ensuring that the rights of individuals are protected and the rule of law is upheld.\n\nIt is crucial to note that the Parliament has the power to make laws and modify existing ones, but this power must be exercised within the limits set by the Constitution.
